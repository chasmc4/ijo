## variants_survey_for_unicode_proposal_2024_01_12.qsf

#### Context

This was created by jan Kekan San, with glyph images provided by jan Lepeka, for the Unicode proposal that began in January 2024.

The survey was distributed on 01-12-2024 and concluded on 01-19-2024.

#### Design

Section 1 is all demographics, asking for the user's name, how long they've spoken toki pona separated into exponentially increasing segments, how long they've used sitelen pona separated into the same segments, how often they write sitelen pona by hand, and how often they write sitelen pona via a tool.

Section 2 is one question per word. The first half of the question asks whether the respondent uses the word, combined with whether they use the word in sitelen pona. The second half of the question provides all relevant variants of the word and a write-in "other" field, which respondents may select any number of including the other field.

#### Results

As we did not explicitly ask respondents to let us publish their individual results, only final results are provided in the following two charts.
